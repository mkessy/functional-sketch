# Functional Sketchbook 

This is my in-progress space for exploring generative art/coding using functional programming paradigms.

Some goals for this project:
1. Make cool art
2. Deepen my understanding of various functional programming concepts and methods
3. Investigate and implement interesting algorithms and data-structures
4. Explore new libraries and technologies
