# Functional Sketchbook 

This is my in-progress space for exploring generative art/coding using functional programming paradigms.

Some goals for this project:
1. Make cool art
2. Deepen my understanding of various functional programming concepts and methods
3. Investigate and implement interesting algorithms and data-structures
4. Explore new libraries and technologies


Currently most of the code is in TypeScript. I'm using the amazing [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library that implements popular patterns and abstractions available in most functional languages. For interacting with the canvas I'm using [graphics-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/graphics-ts) (built on fp-ts) which is a port of canvas libraries in PureScript.
